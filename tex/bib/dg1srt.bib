abstract = {Discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods (DGFEM) offer certain advantages over standard continuous finite element methods when applied to the spatial discretisation of the acoustic wave equation. For instance, the mass matrix has a block diagonal structure which, used in conjunction with an explicit time stepping scheme, gives an extremely economical scheme for time domain simulation. This feature is ubiquitous and extends to other time-dependent wave problems such as Maxwell's equations. An important consideration in computational wave propagation is the dispersive and dissipative properties of the discretisation scheme in comparison with those of the original system. We investigate these properties for two popular DGFEM schemes: the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin finite element method applied to the second-order wave equation and a more general family of schemes applied to the corresponding first order system. We show how the analysis of the multi-dimensional case may be reduced in consideration of one-dimensional problems. We derive the dispersion error for various schemes and conjecture on the generalisation to higher order approximation in space}}

We formulate the space-time DG finite element discretization in an efficient and conservative discretization. The HLLC flux is used as numerical flux through the finite element boundaries. When discontinuities are present, we locally apply dissipation around these discontinuities with the help of Krivodonova\&psila;s discontinuity indicator such that spurious oscillations are suppressed. The non-linear algebraic system resulting from the discretization is solved using a pseudo-time integration with a second-order five-stage Runge-Kutta method. A thorough verification of the space-time DG finite element method is undertaken by comparing numerical and exact solutions. We also carry out a discrete Fourier analysis of the one-dimensional linear rotating shallow water equations to show that the method is unconditionally stable with minimal dispersion and dissipation error. The numerical scheme is validated in a novel way by considering various simulations of bore-vortex interactions in combination with a qualitative analysis of PV generation by non-uniform bores. Finally, the space-time DG method is particularly suited for problems where dynamic grid motion is required. To demonstrate this we simulate waves generated by a wave maker and verify these for low amplitude waves where linear theory is approximately valid.}}

We now present two alternative stencil choosing schemes to automate the choice of post-processing stencil. The first is an ENO type stencil choosing procedure, which is designed to choose centered post-processing in smooth regions and one-sided or partially one-sided post-processing near a discontinuity, and the second method is based on the edge detection method designed by R.

In this work, we propose a new approach for the DG numerical solution of the INS equations written in conservation form. The inviscid numerical fluxes both in the continuity and in the momentum equation are computed using the values of velocity and pressure provided by the (exact) solution of the Riemann problem associated with a local artificial compressibility perturbation of the equations. Unlike in most of the existing methods, artificial compressibility is here introduced only at the interface flux level, therefore resulting in a consistent discretization of the INS equations irrespectively of the amount of artificial compressibility introduced. The discretization of the viscous term follows the well-established DG scheme named BR2. The performance and the accuracy of the method are demonstrated by computing the Kovasznay flow and the two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow for a wide range of Reynolds numbers and for various degrees of polynomial approximation.}}

The method here presented is designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the solution at low Mach numbers using both explicit and implicit schemes for the temporal discretization of the compressible Euler equations. The algorithm is based on a classical preconditioning technique that in general entails modifying both the instationary term of the governing equations and the dissipative term of the numerical flux function (full preconditioning approach). In the paper we show that full preconditioning is beneficial for explicit time integration while the implicit scheme turns out to be efficient and accurate using just the modified numerical flux function. Thus the implicit scheme could also be used for time accurate computations. The performance of the method is demonstrated by solving an inviscid flow past a NACA0012 airfoil at different low Mach numbers using various degrees of polynomial approximations. Computations with and without preconditioning are performed on different grid topologies to analyze the influence of the spatial discretization on the accuracy of the DG solutions at low Mach numbers.}}

The method is able to deal with both non dispersive or dispersive waves, i.e. waves for which the phase speed varies with wavenumber.

abstract = {In this paper we present a new method for the numerical solution of the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system on a phase-space grid using an adaptive semi-Lagrangian method. The adaptivity is performed through a wavelet multiresolution analysis, which gives a powerful and natural refinement criterion based on the local measurement of the approximation error and regularity of the distribution function. Therefore, the multiscale expansion of the distribution function allows to get a sparse representation of the data and thus save memory space and CPU time. We apply this numerical scheme to reduced Vlasov-Maxwell systems arising in laser-plasma physics. Interaction of relativistically strong laser pulses with overdense plasma slabs is investigated. These Vlasov simulations revealed a rich variety of phenomena associated with the fast particle dynamics induced by electromagnetic waves as electron trapping, particle acceleration, and electron plasma wavebreaking. However, the wavelet based adaptive method that we developed here, does not yield significant improvements compared to Vlasov solvers on a uniform mesh due to the substantial overhead that the method introduces. Nonetheless they might be a first step towards more efficient adaptive solvers based on different ideas for the grid refinement or on a more efficient implementation. Here the Vlasov simulations are performed in a two-dimensional phase-space where the development of thin filaments, strongly amplified by relativistic effects requires an important increase of the total number of points of the phase-space grid as they get finer as time goes on. The adaptive method could be more useful in cases where these thin filaments that need to be resolved are a very small fraction of the hyper-volume, which arises in higher dimensions because of the surface-to-volume scaling and the essentially one-dimensional structure of the filaments. Moreover, the main way to improve the efficiency of the adaptive method is to increase the local character in phase-space of the numerical scheme, by considering multiscale reconstruction with more compact support and by replacing the semi-Lagrangian method with more local - in space - numerical scheme as compact finite difference schemes, discontinuous-Galerkin method or finite element residual schemes which are well suited for parallel domain decomposition techniques..}}

The thermal confinement of a magnetized fusion plasma is essentially determined by the turbulent heat conduction across the equilibrium magnetic field. It has long been acknowledged, that the prediction of turbulent transport requires to solve Vlasov-type gyrokinetic equations. Although the kinetic description is more accurate than fluid models (MHD, gyro-fluid), because among other things it takes into account nonlinear resonant wave-particle interaction, kinetic modeling has the drawback of a huge computer resource request. An unifying approach consists in considering water-bag-like weak solutions of kinetic collisionless equations, which allow to reduce the full kinetic Vlasov equation into a set of hydrodynamic equations, while keeping its kinetic behaviour. As a result this exact reduction induces a multi-fluid numerical resolution cost. Therefore finding water-bag-like weak solutions of the gyrokinetic equations leads to the birth of the gyro-water-bag model. This model is suitable for studying linear and nonlinear low-frequency micro-instabilities and the associated anomalous transport in magnetically-confined plasmas. The present paper addresses the derivation of the nonlinear gyro-water-bag model, its quasilinear approximation and their numerical approximations by Runge-Kutta semi-Lagrangian methods and Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin schemes respectively.}}

We present a novel numerical algorithm to treat flooding and drying in a formally second-order explicit space discontinuous Galerkin finite-element discretization of the one-dimensional or symmetric shallow-water equations. The algorithm uses fixed Eulerian flooded elements and a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian element at each free boundary. When the time step is suitably restricted, we show that the mean water depth is positive. This time-step restriction is based on an analysis of the discretized continuity equation while using the HLLC flux. The algorithm and its implementation are tested in comparison with a large and relevant suite of known exact solutions. The essence of the flooding and drying algorithm pivots around the analysis of a continuity equation with a fluid velocity and a pseudodensity (in the shallow water case the depth). It therefore also applies, for example, to space discontinuous Galerkin finite-element discretizations of the compressible Euler equations in which vacuum regions emerge, in analogy of the above dry regions.

We incorporate this idea into the finite element framework by using hierarchical functions as a multi-frequency basis. The result is a new finite element method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. For this method, convergence for a one-dimensional scalar conservation law has previously been proved. Here, the method is described in detail, several issues connected with its efficient implementation are considered, and numerical results for several examples involving one- and two-dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws are provided. Several advantageous features of the method are discussed, including the ease for which discontinuities can be detected and artificial diffusion can be applied anisotropically and locally in physical as well as frequency space.}}

Following previous treatments, the scheme is based on the evolution of a wavefront in phase-space, defined as the intersection of level sets satisfying the relevant Liouville equation. In contrast with previous work, however, our numerical approximation is specifically designed: (i) to take full advantage of the smoothness of solutions; (ii) to facilitate the treatment of scattering obstacles, all while retaining high-order convergence characteristics. Indeed, to incorporate the full regularity of solutions that results from the unfolding of singularities, our method is based on their spectral representation; to enable a simple high-order treatment of scattering boundaries, on the other hand, we resort to a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the solution of the resulting system of equations. The procedure is complemented with the use of a recently derived strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK) scheme for the time integration that, as we demonstrate, allows for overall approximations that are rapidly convergent.}}

The benefit of these systems are that, by integration over the water depth, a two-dimensional system is obtained which approximates the full three-dimensional problem. Nevertheless, for most applications the need to propagate waves over many wavelengths means that the numerical solution of these equations remains particularly challenging. The requirement for an accurate discretization in geometrically complex domains makes the use of spectral/hp elements attractive. However, to allow for the possibility of discontinuous solutions the most natural formulation of the system is within a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework. In this paper we consider the unstructured spectral/hp DG formulation of (i) weakly nonlinear dispersive Boussinesq equations and (ii) nonlinear shallow water equations (a subset of the Boussinesq equations). Discretization of the Boussinesq equations involves resolving third order mixed derivatives.

Both analyses clearly distinguish between the effects of the operator splitting and the discretization of each component of the decomposed problem. The hybrid analysis has the form of a computable a posteriori leading order expression and a provably higher order a priori expression.

abstract = {In the paper, we describe a numerical technique allowing the solution of compressible inviscid flow with a wide range of Mach numbers. The method is based on the application of the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the space discretization of the Euler equations written in the conservative form, combined with a semi-implicit time discretization. Special attention is paid to the treatment of boundary conditions and to the stabilization of the method in the vicinity of discontinuities avoiding the Gibbs phenomenon. As a result we obtain a technique allowing the numerical solution of flows with practically all Mach numbers without any modification of the Euler equations. This means that the proposed method can be used for the solution of high speed flows as well as low Mach number flows. Presented numerical tests prove the accuracy of the method and its robustness with respect to the Mach number.}}

The causality property of Eikonal equations is incorporated into the design of this solver. The resulting local nonlinear system in the Gauss-Seidel iterations is a simple quadratic system and can be solved explicitly. The compactness of the DG method and the fast sweeping strategy lead to fast convergence of the new scheme for Eikonal equations. Extensive numerical examples verify efficiency, convergence and second order accuracy of the proposed method.}}

It is found that the method requires only a small number of elements per wavelength to obtain accurate solutions and that it is more efficient than high-order DRP schemes. In addition, the conditioning of the method is found to be high but not critical in practice. It is shown that the ultra-weak variational formulation is in fact a subset of the present discontinuous Galerkin method. A special extension of the method is devised in order to deal with singular solutions generated by point sources like monopoles or dipoles.

We study three different forms of the governing equations using seven test cases. Three test cases involve flow over mountains which require the implementation of non-reflecting boundary conditions, while one test requires viscous terms (density current). Including viscous stresses into finite difference, finite element, or spectral element models poses no additional challenges; however, including these terms to either finite volume or discontinuous Galerkin models requires the introduction of additional machinery because these methods were originally designed for first-order operators. We use the local discontinuous Galerkin method to overcome this obstacle. The seven test cases show that all of our models yield good results. The main conclusion is that equation set 1 (non-conservation form) does not perform as well as sets 2 and 3 (conservation forms). For the density current (viscous), the SE and DG models using set 3 (mass and total energy) give less dissipative results than the other equation sets; based on these results we recommend set 3 for the development of future multiscale research codes. In addition, the fact that set 3 conserves both mass and energy up to machine precision motives us to pursue this equation set for the development of future mesoscale models. For the bubble and mountain tests, the DG models performed better. Based on these results and due to its conservation properties we recommend the DG method. In the worst case scenario, the DG models are 50% slower than the non-conservative SE models. In the best case scenario, the DG models are just as efficient as the conservative SE models..}}

This deterministic solver gives direct access to the kinetic density that is the solution to the Boltzmann equation, as a function of position, velocity, and time. It is valuable to have direct access to the velocity dependence in order to analyze the underlying kinetic causes of macroscopic observables.

To suppress spurious numerical oscillations near discontinuities or high gradients, Galerkin/least-squares stabilization has been applied. Further improvement of the numerical representation of the transient elastic wave propagation phenomena has been achieved by specially designed Galerkin/gradient least-squares operators. Because of the reduced phase and amplitude errors of these finite elements, much coarser spatial meshes may be used without loss of accuracy. The resulting reduction of the number of unknowns leads to a significant decrease of computer time. Furthermore, a global adaptive time-stepping strategy has been employed based on the temporal jump residual of the time finite element method as error estimator. Numerical examples of transient elastic wave propagation in Timoshenko beams involving a wide spectrum of wave numbers and frequencies demonstrate the good performance of the developed methods}}

The simple approach of performing iterative relaxation on solution approximations of decreasing polynomial degree p down to p = 0 and then applying geometric multigrid is ineffective. The transition from p = 1 top = 0 causes the performance of the entire iteration to degrade because the long wavelength eigenfunctions of the p = 1 discontinuous system are not represented well in the p = 0 space. A new approach is proposed that coarsens from the p = 1 discontinuous space to the p = 1 continuous space. This approach eliminates the problems caused by the p = 1 to p = 0 transition. Furthermore, the p = 1 continuous space is a standard finite element space for which geometric multigrid is well-defined. In addition, when the discontinuous Galerkin equations are restricted to a continuous space, one recovers the Galerkin formulation of continuous finite elements. Thus, applying geometric multigrid to this system is straightforward and effective. Numerical tests agree well with the analysis and confirm that the new approach gives rapid convergence rates that are grid-independent and only weakly sensitive to the polynomial order.}}

Unlike the traditional discontinuous Galerkin methods, where either standard Lagrange finite element or hierarchical node-based basis functions are used to represent numerical polynomial solutions in each element, this DG method represents the numerical polynomial solutions using a Taylor series expansion at the centroid of the cell. Consequently, this formulation is able to provide a unified framework, where both cell-centered and vertex-centered finite volume schemes can be viewed as special cases of this discontinuous Galerkin method by choosing reconstruction schemes to compute the derivatives, offer the insight why the DG methods are a better approach than the finite volume methods based on either TVD/MUSCL reconstruction or essentially non-oscillatory (ENO)/weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction, and has a number of distinct, desirable, and attractive features, which can be effectively used to address some of shortcomings of the DG methods. The developed method is used to compute a variety of both steady-state and time-accurate flow problems on arbitrary grids. The numerical results demonstrated the superior accuracy of this discontinuous Galerkin method in comparison with a second order finite volume method and a third-order WENO method, indicating its promise and potential to become not just a competitive but simply a superior approach than its finite volume and ENO/WENO counterparts for solving flow problems of scientific and industrial interest..}}

abstract = {We present a detailed study of spatially propagating waves in a discontinuous Galerkin scheme applied to a system of linear hyperbolic equations. We start with an eigensolution analysis of the semidiscrete system in one space dimension with uniform grids. It is found that for any given order of the basis functions, there are at most two spatially propagating numerical wave modes for each physical wave of the partial differential equations (PDE). One of the modes can accurately represent the physical wave of the PDE and the other is spurious. The directions of propagation of these two numerical modes are opposite, and, in most practical cases, the spurious mode has a large damping rate. Furthermore, when an exact characteristics split flux formula is used, the spurious mode becomes nonexistent. For the physically accurate mode, it is shown analytically that the numerical dispersion relation is accurate to order 2p+2, where p is the highest order of the basis polynomials. The results of eigensolution analysis are then utilized to study the effects of a grid discontinuity, caused by an abrupt change in grid size, on the numerical solutions at either side of the interface. It is shown that due to "mode decoupling," numerical reflections at grid discontinuity, when they occur, are always in the form of the spurious nonphysical mode. Closed-form numerical reflection and transmission coefficients are given and analyzed. Numerical examples that illustrate the analytical findings of the paper are also presented}}

abstract = {A global model of the atmosphere is presented governed by the shallow water equations and discretized by a Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method on an unstructured triangular grid. The shallow water equations on the sphere, a two-dimensional surface in \&Ropf;<sup>3</sup>, are locally represented in terms of spherical triangular coordinates, the appropriate local coordinate mappings on triangles. On every triangular grid element, this leads to a two-dimensional representation of tangential momentum and therefore only two discrete momentum equations. The discontinuous Galerkin method consists of an integral formulation which requires both area (elements) and line (element faces) integrals. Here, we use a Rusanov numerical flux to resolve the discontinuous fluxes at the element faces. A strong stability-preserving third-order Runge-Kutta method is applied for the time discretization. The polynomial space of order k on each curved triangle of the grid is characterized by a Lagrange basis and requires high-order quadature rules for the integration over elements and element faces. For the presented method no mass matrix inversion is necessary, except in a preprocessing step. The validation of the atmospheric model has been done considering standard tests from Williamson et al. [D.L. Williamson, J.B. Drake, J.J. Hack, R. Jakob, P.N. Swarztrauber, A standard test set for numerical approximations to the shallow water equations in spherical geometry, J. Comput.

The schemes we present extend the previous works of Yan and Shu on approximating solutions for linear dispersive equations and for certain KdV-type equations. We present two classes of DG methods for approximating solutions of such PDEs. First, we generate nonlinearly stable numerical schemes with a stability condition that is induced from a conservation law of the PDE. An alternative approach is based on constructing linearly stable schemes, i.e., schemes that are linearly stable to small perturbations. The numerical simulations we present verify the desired properties of the methods including their expected order of accuracy. In particular, we demonstrate the potential advantages of using DG methods over pseudospectral methods in situations where discontinuous fronts and rapid oscillations co-exist in a solution}}

abstract = {In this paper we propose a discontinuous Galerkin scheme for the numerical approximation of unsteady heat conduction and diffusion problems in multi dimensions. The scheme is based on a discrete space-time variational formulation and uses an explicit approximative solution as predictor. This predictor is obtained by a Taylor expansion about the barycenter of each grid cell at the old time level in which all time or mixed space-time derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using the differential equation several times. The heat flux between adjacent grid cells is approximated by a local analytical solution. It takes into account that the approximate solution may be discontinuous at grid cell interfaces and allows the approximation of discontinuities in the heat conduction coefficient. The presented explicit scheme has to satisfy a typical parabolic stability restriction. The loss of efficiency, especially in the case of strongly varying sizes of cells in unstructured grids, is circumvented by allowing different time steps in each grid cell which are adopted to the local stability restrictions. We discuss the linear stability properties in this case of varying diffusion coefficients, varying space increments and local time steps and extent these considerations also to a modified symmetric interior penalization scheme. In numerical simulations we show the efficiency and the optimal order of convergence in space and time.}}

Without a limiter, the DG method gives an accurate discretization of the Chapman-Enskog approximation of the system when the relaxation length scale is not resolved. It is well known that the first-order upwind (or \&ldquo;step\&rdquo;) method fails to obtain the proper asymptotic limit. We show that using the minmod slope limiter also fails, but that using double minmod gives the proper asymptotic limit. Despite its effectiveness in the asymptotic limit, the double minmod limiter allows artificial extrema at cell interfaces, referred to as \&ldquo;sawteeth\&rdquo;.

In this paper we present a semi-implicit, linear discontinuous Galerkin method for the spherical harmonics (P<sub>N</sub>) equations for thermal radiative transfer in planar geometry. Our method is novel in that the material coupling terms are treated implicitly (via linearizing the emission source) and the streaming operator is treated explicitly using a second-order accurate Runge-Kutta method. The benefit of this approach is that each time step only involves the solution of equations that are local to each cell. This benefit comes at the cost of having the time step limited by a CFL condition based on the speed of light. To guarantee positivity and avoid artificial oscillations, we use a slope-limiting technique. We present analysis and numerical results that show the method is robust in the diffusion limit when the photon mean-free path is not resolved by the spatial mesh. Also, in the diffusion limit the time step restriction relaxes to a less restrictive explicit diffusion CFL condition. We demonstrate with numerical results that away from the diffusion limit our method demonstrates second-order error convergence as the spatial mesh is refined with a fixed CFL number..}}

However, it is shown that bifurcations in the time domain are manifested as discontinuities in the stochastic domain, which are problematic for solution with these spectral approaches. Because of this, a new algorithm is introduced based on the stochastic projection method but employing a multivariate B spline. Samples are obtained by choosing nodes on the stochastic axes. These samples are used to build an interpolating function in the stochastic domain. Monte Carlo simulations are then very efficiently performed on this interpolating function to estimate probability density functions of a response. The results from this nonintrusive and non-Galerkin approach are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of the governing equations, but at a computational cost 2 orders of magnitude less than a traditional Monte Carlo approach.

The spatial discretization is carried out using a discontinuous Galerkin method with fourth order polynomial interpolations on triangular elements. The time integration is based on backward difference formulas resulting in a nonlinear system of equations which is solved at each timestep. This is accomplished using Newton's method. The resulting linear systems are solved using a preconditioned GMRES iterative algorithm. We consider several existing preconditioners such as block Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel combined with multilevel schemes which have been developed and tested for specific applications. While our results are consistent with the claims reported, we find that these preconditioners lack robustness when used in more challenging situations involving low Mach numbers, stretched grids, or high Reynolds number turbulent flows. We propose a preconditioner based on a coarse scale correction with postsmoothing based on a block incomplete LU factorization with zero fill-in (ILU0) of the Jacobian matrix. The performance of the ILU0 smoother is found to depend critically on the element numbering. We propose a numbering strategy based on minimizing the discarded fill-in in a greedy fashion. The coarse scale correction scheme is found to be important for diffusion dominated problems, whereas the ILUO preconditioner with the proposed ordering is effective at handling the convection dominated case. While little can be said in the way of theoretical results, the proposed preconditioner is shown to perform remarkably well for a broad range of representative test problems. These include compressible flows ranging from very low Reynolds numbers to fully turbulent flows using the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations discretized on highly stretched grids. For low Mach number flows, the proposed preconditioner is more than one order of magnitude more efficient than the other preconditioners considered.}}

We demonstrate that the approaches are fully equivalent and give identical results in terms of accuracy, convergence and restriction on the time step. However, the scalar method is shown to be more CPU efficient for high order expansions, in addition to requiring less storage.}}

We take two examples, one from compressible gas dynamics where the micro sub-domains are around shocks, contacts and corners of rarefaction fans, and another one from semiconductor device simulations where the micro sub-domains are around the jumps in the doping profile. The macro model is taken as the Euler equations for the gas dynamics problem and as a hydrodynamic model and a high field model for the semiconductor device problem. The micro model for both problems is taken as a kinetic equation. We pay special attention to the effective coupling between the macro sub-domains and the micro sub-domains, in which we utilize the advantage of the discontinuous Galerkin method in its compactness of the computational stencil. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DDM-DG method in solving such multi-scale problems.}}

The nonlinear equations of the space-time discretization are solved using a multigrid accelerated pseudo-time-integration technique with an optimized Runge-Kutta method. The linear stability of the pseudo-time-integration method is investigated for the linear advection equation. The numerical scheme is demonstrated with simulations of the flow field in a shock tube, a channel with a bump, and an oscillating NACA 0012 airfoil. These simulations show that using the data at the superconvergence points, the accuracy of the numerical discretization is O(h<sup>5/2</sup>) in space for smooth subsonic flows, both on structured and on locally refined meshes, and that the space-time adaptation can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical method}}

Based on the prototypical one-dimensional Poisson problem, we establish in this work that most concurrent discontinuous Galerkin formulations for second-order elliptic problems represent instances of a, generic conventional formulation and that this generic formulation is noncoercive. Consequently, all conventional discontinuous Galerkin formulations are a fortiori noncoercive, and typical their well-posedness is contingent on approximation-space-dependent stabilization parameters. Moreover, we present a new symmetric nonconventional discontinuous Galerkin formulation based on element Green's functions and the data local to the edges. We show that the new discontinuous Galerkin formulation is coercive on the broken Sobolev space H<sup>1</sup>(P<sup>h</sup>), viz., the space of functions that are element wise in the H<sup>1</sup> Sobolev space. The coercivity of the new formulation is supported by calculations of discrete inf-sup constants, and numerical results are presented to illustrate the optimal convergence behavior in the energy-norm and in the L<sub>2</sub>(\&Omega;)-norm}}

One of the fundamental properties of the DG methodology and arguably its most powerful property is the ability to combine high-order discretizations on an inter-element level while allowing discontinuities between elements. This flexibility, however, generates a plethora of difficulties when one attempts to use DG fields for feature extraction and visualization, as most post-processing schemes are not designed for handling explicitly discontinuous fields. This work introduces a new method of applying smoothness-increasing, accuracy-conserving filtering on discontinuous Galerkin vector fields for the purpose of enhancing streamline integration. The filtering discussed in this paper enhances the smoothness of the field and eliminates the discontinuity between elements, thus resulting in more accurate streamlines. Furthermore, as a means of minimizing the computational cost of the method, the filtering is done in a one-dimensional manner along the streamline.}}

abstract = {The central scheme of Nessyami and Tadmor [J. Comput. Phys., 87 (1990), pp. 408-463] solves hyperbolic conservation laws on a staggered mesh and avoids solving Riemann problems across cell boundaries. To overcome the difficulty of excessive numerical dissipation for small time steps, the work of Kurganov and Tadmor [J. Comput. Phys., 160 (2000), pp. 241-282] employs a variable control volume, which in turn yields a semidiscrete nonstaggered central scheme. Another approach, which we advocate here, is to view the staggered meshes as a collection of overlapping cells and to realize the computed solution by its overlapping cell averages. This leads to a simple technique to avoid the excessive numerical dissipation for small time steps [Y. Liu, J. Comput. Phys., 209 (2005), pp. 82-104]. At the heart of the proposed approach is the evolution of two pieces of information per cell, instead of one cell average which characterizes all central and upwind Godunov-type finite volume schemes. Overlapping cells lend themselves to the development of a central-type discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, following the series of works by Cockburn and Shu [J. Comput. Phys., 141 (1998), pp. 199-224] and the references therein. In this paper we develop a central DG technique for hyperbolic conservation laws, where we take advantage of the redundant representation of the solution on overlapping cells. The use of redundant overlapping cells opens new possibilities beyond those of Godunov-type schemes. In particular, the central DG is coupled with a novel reconstruction procedure which removes spurious oscillations in the presence of shocks. This reconstruction is motivated by the moments limiter of Biswas, Devine, and Flaherty [Appl. Numer. Math., 14 (1994), pp. 255-283] but is otherwise different in its hierarchical approach. The new hierarchical reconstruction involves a MUSCL or a second order ENO reconstruction in each stage of a multilayer reconstruction process without characteristic decomposition. It is compact, easy to implement over arbitrary meshes, and retains the overall preprocessed order of accuracy while effectively removing spurious oscillations around shocks.}}

We show that on triangular grids, the use of center biased limiter functions is essential in order to recover the desired order of accuracy. Several new techniques have been developed in the paper: (a) we develop a WENO-type linear reconstruction in each hierarchical level, which solves the accuracy degeneracy problem of previous limiter functions and is essentially independent of the local mesh structure; (b) we find that HR using partial neighboring cells significantly reduces over/under-shoots, and further improves the resolution of the numerical solutions. The method is compact and therefore easy to implement. Numerical computations for scalar and systems of nonlinear hyperbolic equations are performed. We demonstrate that the procedure can generate essentially non-oscillatory solutions while keeping the resolution and desired order of accuracy for smooth solutions.}}
